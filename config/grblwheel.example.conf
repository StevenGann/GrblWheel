# GrblWheel config (used by launch-candle.sh and setup).
# Copy to grblwheel.conf and edit as needed.
# Candle does not accept serial port on the command line; set it once in Candle's Settings.

# Serial port for GRBL (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0). For display/reference only unless Candle adds CLI support.
# serial_port=/dev/ttyUSB0

# Start Candle in fullscreen (launcher passes -fullscreen by default).
# fullscreen=true
